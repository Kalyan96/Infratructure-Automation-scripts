### Summary:

This project demonstrates advanced **network automation and infrastructure management** skills by using **Python, Netmiko, and NAPALM** libraries to interact with network devices like Cisco routers and switches. The scripts are part of a larger initiative to automate network configurations, monitor device states, and retrieve critical information from the network infrastructure. Below is a detailed breakdown of the capabilities and how they highlight my expertise:

---

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Device Connection Management**:
   - Establishes secure connections with network devices using `Netmiko`.
   - Enables privileged EXEC mode to perform high-level configurations and retrieve device details.

2. **Automation of OSPF Management**:
   - Dynamically modifies OSPF configurations (`shutdown` and `no shutdown` commands) to test routing behavior.

3. **Interface State Management**:
   - Identifies interfaces that are down and automates their activation (`no shutdown`).
   - Retrieves the state of all interfaces (both up and down) for audit and logging purposes.

4. **ECMP Route Analysis**:
   - Parses and identifies Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routes from the routing table, providing insights into the load-sharing configurations of the network.

5. **Configuration Persistence**:
   - Saves running configurations to NVRAM to ensure changes are not lost after device reboot.

6. **File Transfer Using SCP**:
   - Demonstrates file transfer capabilities to network devices, showcasing integration with SCP for automation workflows like configuration backup and deployment.

7. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Extracts key performance indicators like Round-Trip Time (RTT) for pinged IPs.
   - Saves results in structured formats (e.g., `ping.txt`).

8. **ARP Table Retrieval**:
   - Leverages `NAPALM` to extract ARP table details (IP-MAC mappings) for network troubleshooting and documentation.

### **Key Highlights of My Skills**
- **Network Automation Expertise**:
   - Deep understanding of network protocols (e.g., OSPF, ECMP) and their automation.
   - Proficient in Python libraries like `Netmiko` and `NAPALM` to handle both CLI-based and API-based device management.

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Incorporates modular and reusable functions for configurations (`push_conf`, `get_interfaces_down`, etc.), aligning with industry best practices.

- **Log Management**:
   - Automates logging of interface states, configuration changes, and performance metrics, ensuring comprehensive network documentation.

- **File Handling and Reporting**:
   - Demonstrates efficient file operations to save network data (e.g., ARP tables, RTT metrics) for audits and future reference.

- **Error Handling and Resiliency**:
   - Implements robust workflows to handle varied network conditions (e.g., detecting all interfaces down/up).

- **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Showcases device interactions with both Cisco IOS and Linux-based systems, underlining versatility in handling diverse network environments.

### **Use cases**
By integrating these scripts into a DevOps or NetOps pipeline, organizations can:
1. Save hours of manual labor through automation.
2. Minimize human errors in configuration changes.
3. Enhance network visibility with automated logs and performance metrics.
4. Build scalable, repeatable workflows for network management.
